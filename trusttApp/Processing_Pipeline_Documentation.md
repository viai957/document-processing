## Introduction and Requirements

Handling up to 100,000 multi-page documents in both batch and real-time modes is a significant engineering challenge. The goal is to achieve fast turnaround (â‰ˆ60 seconds for a 100-page document) without sacrificing accuracy or reliability. To meet these requirements, we propose a cloud-agnostic, modular pipeline that integrates several powerful tools:

- Ray for parallel processing
- Apache Airflow for orchestration and quality control
- PySpark for distributed data handling
- MLflow for model tracking and deployment

The system is designed to be horizontally scalable, extensible, and deployable on generic cloud infrastructure (e.g. AWS EC2 or on-prem Kubernetes) rather than tied to specific proprietary services.

### Key Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each pipeline stage (OCR, layout analysis, data conversion, etc.) is isolated, allowing independent scaling and upgrades
- **Layout-aware Document Understanding**: Uses LayoutLMv3-based model to detect document components with multimodal context
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Parallel processing at page/layout-segment level using Ray
- **Real-time Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) support for incremental results
- **Confidence-based QA**: Fallback mechanisms and human review for low-confidence cases
- **Flexible Output Handling**: Support for JSON, CSV, Markdown, and database storage
- **Validation Layer**: JSON schema verification and field-level quality checks
- **Storage Abstraction**: Seamless reading/writing from S3, HDFS, or local file systems
- **BFSI Domain Integration**: Fine-tuned Mistral LLM for document classification

## High-Level Architecture Overview

The pipeline processes documents through a sequence of stages, each handled by a dedicated service:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Ingestion] --> B[Classification]
    B --> C[OCR]
    C --> D[Layout Analysis]
    D --> E[Data Conversion]
    E --> F[Validation/QC]
    F --> G[Output Storage/Delivery]
```

### Key Architectural Elements

1. **Orchestration & Workflow Manager**
   - Airflow DAG for batch processing
   - FastAPI with Ray Serve for real-time requests

2. **Parallel Compute Layer**
   - Ray cluster for distributed processing
   - Layout-level parallelism
   - Multi-document parallel processing

3. **Data and Model Storage**
   - Abstracted storage layer
   - MLflow for model tracking
   - Model registry integration

4. **Messaging/Queueing**
   - Internal message broker (optional)
   - Ray task scheduling
   - Airflow for batch jobs

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Component metrics
   - MLflow tracking
   - Custom monitoring dashboards
